#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### suggests study timelines and priorities.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The files that will most likely need to be edited to satisfy your request are:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – to update the app’s title and description.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – to generate a new logo image for the app.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
